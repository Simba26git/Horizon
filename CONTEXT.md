**Project Name: AI-Powered House Construction Quotation System**

**Overview:**
The goal of this project is to create a web application that provides automated house construction cost quotations. The system will use AI and other tools to calculate the cost of building materials, equipment, and labor. It will also identify the exact prices and locations of these materials from different hardware suppliers. Users will be able to download a detailed quotation in PDF format.

**Key Features:**
1. **AI-Powered Cost Estimation:**
   - AI will analyze input parameters (e.g., house size, materials, labor costs) to generate accurate construction quotations.
   - Predict costs based on historical data, inflation rates, and supplier pricing.

2. **Material & Equipment Sourcing:**
   - Fetch real-time prices from hardware suppliers using web scraping techniques.
   - Suggest alternative materials or suppliers based on budget.

3. **Quotation Generation:**
   - Create detailed cost breakdowns including materials, labor, transportation, and miscellaneous costs.
   - Provide downloadable PDF quotations.

4. **User Input & Customization:**
   - Allow users to enter project details (e.g., house type, number of rooms, location).
   - Enable customization of material preferences and quality levels.

5. **Supplier Integration via Web Scraping:**
   - Use web scraping tools (BeautifulSoup, Scrapy, Selenium, or Puppeteer) to extract pricing from hardware supplier websites.
   - Regularly update the database with scraped pricing data.
   - Implement fallback AI-based price estimation if real-time data is unavailable.

6. **Backend: Supabase**
   - User authentication and profile management.
   - Store past quotations and allow users to retrieve them later.
   - Database for material pricing, supplier information, and quotation history.

7. **Frontend:**
   - User-friendly UI for input and quotation display.
   - Responsive design for both mobile and desktop use.
   - Dynamic updates based on user selections.

8. **Additional Functionalities:**
   - AI chatbot for guidance on cost-saving measures.
   - Multi-currency and tax inclusion based on location.
   - Email notifications with quotation download links.

**Tech Stack:**
- **Frontend:** React (Next.js for SSR and performance optimization)
- **Backend:** Supabase (PostgreSQL, authentication, and storage)
- **AI/ML:** Python (FastAPI or Flask for AI calculations)
- **Web Scraping:** BeautifulSoup, Scrapy, Selenium, or Puppeteer for extracting supplier pricing
- **PDF Generation:** jsPDF or Puppeteer for generating downloadable quotations
- **Deployment:** Vercel (for frontend), Supabase backend hosting

**Development Roadmap:**
1. **Planning & Research:** Define data sources, supplier partnerships, and AI training datasets.
2. **Backend Development:** Set up Supabase, database schema, and API endpoints.
3. **AI & Web Scraping Integration:** Develop cost estimation model using Python and implement web scraping.
4. **Frontend Development:** Build user interface and integrate with backend.
5. **Testing & Optimization:** Ensure accuracy of cost calculations and supplier data.
6. **Deployment & User Feedback:** Launch MVP and iterate based on user input.

**Expected Outcome:**
A fully functional web application that provides instant house construction cost estimates, accurate material sourcing via web scraping, and downloadable quotations, all powered by AI and Supabase.
